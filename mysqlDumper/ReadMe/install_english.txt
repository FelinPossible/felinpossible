Guidance for the Perl script:  

When you can execute Perl anywhere:  

1. In MySQLDumper switch to the page Backup.  
2. Copy the path, that stands behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:  
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor 
4. paste the copied path there to the $absolute_path_of_configdir-variable (no blanks,no new line) 
5. Save crondump.pl 
6. chmod the scripts to 0755.   
7. If the ending .cgi is desired, change the ending of all 3 files from .pl to .cgi (rename)  
8. If the Scripts are renamed to *.cgi , change Fileextension to cgi in the MySQLDumper Configuration (cronscript)

Done.

--------------------------------------
When perl is only allowed in cgi-bin: 

Many user have a cgi-bin directory, in which Perl can be executed. 
This is usually available via Browser http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/ . 

In this casse do the following steps:  

1.  in MySQLDumper call the page Backup and click "Backup Perl".
2.  Copy the path, that stands behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:    
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor 
4. paste the copied path there with absolute_path_of_configdir (no blanks, no new line) 
5.  Save crondump.pl 
6. copy crondump.pl, as well as perltest.pl and simpletest.pl to the cgi-bin directory (ASCII mode in the ftp-client!) 
7. chmod 755 the scripts to 0755.  
7b. If the ending cgi is desired, change the ending of all 3 files .pl to .cgi (rename)  
8.  in MySQLDumper switch to the page Configuration
9. click on Cronscript 
10. change the Perl execution path to /cgi-bin/ or ./../cgi-bin (depending on your file-structure. Path is relative from MSD-Dir)
10b. if the Scripts are renamed to *.cgi , change Fileextension to cgi 
11 save the Configuration 
-------------------------------------

Ready ! The scripts are now available from the Page "Backup".


Windowsuser must change the first line of all Perlscripts, to the path of Perl.  

Example:  

instead of:  #!/usr/bin/perl w 
now #!C:\perl\bin\perl.exe w
